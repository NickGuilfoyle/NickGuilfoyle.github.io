		<h3>EECS 281 Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<details>
					<summary>Project 1 Maze Solver</summary>
					<p>Maze Solver was the first project I wrote at Michigan where I had to structure the entire project on my own. The project implemented breasummaryh-first and depth-first search algorithms in C++ using queue and stack. These algorithms solved mazes comprised of characters, and were designed with efficiency in mind, being tested on speed for maze files as large as 10,000 rows. Project was an introduction to coding for efficiency, and for structuring a project without skeleton code from professors.</p>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				<details>
					<summary>Project 2 Star Wars</summary>
					<p>Mult-part project centered on the concept of priority queues. The Star Wars application was the largest part of the project where text about Star Wars Battalions was processed into Jedi and Sith priority queues, then processed to create stories of fictional battles. THe project also featured implentations of a basic priority queue, a binary heap, and a pairing heap. Project was mainly to serve as an introduction to priority queues and heaps, and was also our first major implementation of a data structure.</p>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				<details>
					<summary>Project 3 Logman</summary>
					<p>Logman was a program which centered around using maps and vectors to efficiently create search results given a list of error logs in C++. Logs could be sorted or searched based on multiple attributes of multiple types. Project was the first time that I worked with search and sort algorithms in the context of efficiency, and the project was a much deeper exploration of maps and sets than any previous project.</p>
				</details>
			</li>
			<li>
				<details>
					<summary>Project 4 Travelling Salesman</summary>
					<p>Project 4 was a three part project, with every part relating to the travelling salesman problem, and being coded in C++. Part one was a minimum spanning tree implemented using Kruskal's algorithim. Part 2 used the MST's from part 1 to quickly approximate the true value for the travelling salesman problem for large datasets using branch and bound. Part 3 was an exhaustive search to find the true value of travelling salesman on small datasets. This project was an introduction to Branch and Bound, and part 2 required student's to create an algorithm to quickly approximate travelling salesman on their own.</p>
